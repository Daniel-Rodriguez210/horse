    <h1>Horses</h1>
    <p>A horse can rest and even doze while standing by locking one of its hind legs at the stifle joint (basically, the knee). A group of ligaments and tendons called the stay apparatus holds the leg in place with minimal muscle involvement. Horses will switch from leg to leg to prevent fatigue in the locked leg.</p>
    <p>A female horse is called a mare and a male horse is called a stallion. In the wild, the mare decides when the herd moves on and usually only one stallion will stay with a herd.</p>
